## Introduction

This project aims to create, insert, and utilize a database to efficiently manage information. Through this project, we will learn how to design a database, insert data, and perform queries to retrieve relevant information.

## Data Sources

We will use the following data sources for our project:

- **Product data**: Information on available assets, prices included, economic factors and assets.

### Challenges

- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that the inserted data is consistent and valid.
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimizing queries to retrieve information quickly and accurately.

## Key Questions

1. **How ​​to design an efficient database to manage dates, assets and important metrics for the stock market?**
   - **Conclusion**: Use a relational model with well-defined tables and clear relationships between them.

2. **How to insert data securely and efficiently into the database?**
   - **Conclusion**: Use transactions and stored procedures to ensure data integrity.

3. **How to perform queries to retrieve relevant information from the database?**
   - **Conclusion**: Use indexes and query optimizations to improve performance.

## Methodology

### 1. Problem Definition and Hypothesis Formulation
We defined the problem of efficiently managing information and formulated hypotheses on how to design and use the database to solve this problem.

### 2. Database Creation
We design the database structure using a relational model, more information about the database structure. In the files included in this project 'create_database.sql' and entity relationship diagram.


### 3. Data Insertion
We insert data into tables using Python scripts. We ensure data integrity through the use of transactions and stored procedures.

### 4. Analysis and Queries
We performed queries to retrieve relevant information from the database. We used indexes and query optimizations to improve performance.

### 5. Visualization
We created visualizations to represent the information retrieved from the database. We used charts and tables to display the data clearly and comprehensibly.

## Key Findings and Conclusions

1. **Efficient Database Design**: A well-designed relational model allows for efficient and secure information management.
2. **Secure Data Insertion**: Using transactions and stored procedures ensures data integrity.
3. **Optimized Queries**: Query optimization and the use of indexes significantly improve database performance.

## Future Questions

- How can we improve the scalability of the database to handle large volumes of data?
- What additional security techniques can we implement to protect sensitive information?

## Data Sources and Links

- **SQL Documentation**: SQL Documentation
- **Database Tutorials**: Database Tutorials
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib
